# TODO...

- Équation de droite $\overrightarrow{\textbf{r}}=\overrightarrow{\textbf{r}_0}+t\overrightarrow{\textbf{v}}$

- Équation du plan

- Intersection droite avec plan (seulement savoir si il y a intersection et ensuite trouver l'intersection)

- Trouver distance point-droite

- Est-ce qu'un point est au-dessus ou au-dessous d'une droite?

# STL pour STéréoLitographie

- Ce format ne comporte notamment pas d'informations concernant la couleur, la texture ou les autres paramètres habituels d'un modèle de conception assistée par ordinateur.

- Le **format de fichier STL** ne décrit que la géométrie de surface d'un objet en 3 dimensions.

- Cette surface est nécessairement fermée et définie par une série de triangles (ou de facettes). 

- Chaque triangle est défini par les coordonnées cartésiennes (x, y, z) dans un trièdre direct de son vecteur normal unitaire (n) orienté vers l'extérieur de l'objet et de ses trois sommets (vertex/vertices en anglais) ordonnés dans le sens trigonométrique. 

- Chaque triangle doit partager 2 sommets avec chacun des triangles le juxtaposant. Dit autrement, le sommet d'un triangle ne doit pas être sur l'arête d'un autre triangle. Il n'y a pas d'information d'échelle. 

- L'unité de longueur est arbitraire.

# Couper le solide en polygones

## On veut trouver l'intersection d'un plan avec le solide

- Le solide est composé de plusieurs triangles.

- Chaque triangle est composé de trois segments de droites.

- On veut donc savoir si un segment de droite croise le plan.

# Géométrie de construction de solides (ou GCS)

- La GCS permet de représenter simplement un ensemble de points et de travailler ensuite avec ceux-ci à l'intérieur d'un programme informatique;

- La GCS considère que tous les ensembles sont construits à partir d'ensembles **plus simples**, qui font office de blocs de construction;

- Certaines règles simples permettent ensuite d'échafauder des structures complexes.

---

# La représentation GCS d'un polygone

- Nous utiliserons des demi-plans pour représenter un polygone;

- Les règles de construction utilisées seront les mêmes que celles des ensembles:

  - Le complément;
  
  - L'union;
  
  - L'intersection

- Une droite orientée définit un demi-plan $H$ se trouvant à gauche de la droite lorsqu'on se déplace dans la direction définit par l'orientation.

# L'enveloppe convexe

- L'enveloppe convexe d'un objet ou d'un regroupement d'objets géométriques est l'ensemble convexe le plus petit parmi ceux qui le contiennent.

- Dans un plan, l'enveloppe convexe peut être comparée à la région limitée par un élastique qui englobe tous les points qu'on relâche jusqu'à ce qu'il se contracte au maximum. L'idée serait la même dans l'espace avec un ballon qui se dégonflerait jusqu'à être en contact avec tous les points qui sont à la surface de l'enveloppe convexe.
